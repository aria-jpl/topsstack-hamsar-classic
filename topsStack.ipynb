    "Includes commands to unpack Sentinel-1 TOPS SLCs using ISCE readers. For older SLCs which need antenna elevation pattern correction, the file is extracted and written to disk. For newer version of SLCs which don’t need the elevation antenna pattern correction, only a gdal virtual “vrt” file (and isce xml file) is generated. The “.vrt” file points to the Sentinel SLC file and reads them whenever required during the processing. If a user wants to write the “.vrt” SLC file to disk, it can be done easily using gdal_translate (e.g. gdal_translate –of ENVI File.vrt File.slc). \n",
    "The “run_01_unpack_slc_topo_reference” also includes a command that refers to the config file of the stack reference, which includes configuration for running topo for the stack reference. Note that in the pair-wise processing strategy one should run topo (mapping from range-Doppler to geo coordinate) for all pairs. However, with stackSentinel, topo needs to be run only one time for the reference in the stack. \n"
